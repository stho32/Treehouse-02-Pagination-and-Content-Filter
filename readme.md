# Treehouse Pagination and Content Filter

Treehouse Pagination and Content Filter is the second project of the Full Stack Javascript 
Tech Degree.

See Documentation/requirements.md for the instructions.

In short: 

 - There is a list. Paginate it. Filter it. 
 - You can use jquery. 
 - You shall not use jquery plugins.
 - Be unobstrusive.

Although I have included paging, filtering and paging and filtering as separate 
files and made them easy to switch, in my final testing round I only tested the last
one to get my chance on exceeding expectations.

I have tested the functionality in :

- chrome 61.0.3163.100
- FF 56
- safari 

And had much fun doing the coding in vscode.
