# Requirements

In this project, you'll enhance the usability of a web page that has too much information. To make it easier to find information and read the page, you'll use progressive enhancement to add pagination.

The page includes a list of 54 students. You need to add programming to display 10 students per page, and add buttons to jump between the lists of 10 students.

Your solution should work for any number of student listings, whether there were 5, 25, 55 or 100 student listings.

Optionally, you can add a search bar to let users search the list of students for a particular student or students.

Feel free to use jQuery for this project, but please avoid using plugins to achieve the pagination and/or search functionality.

# to pass
When the page loads, your program should hide all but the first 10 students in the list.
Look at the HTML in the example-meets.html on lines 119-137 -- this is an example of the markup you'll need to add dynamically to the index.html page to create pagination links.
Since only 10 students should be shown at a time, your programming needs to calculate the number of pages needed and add the appropriate number of links to the bottom of the page.
When a user clicks on “2” in the pagination, students 11 through 20 are shown. When a user clicks “3”, students 21 through 30 are shown. And so on. When “6” is clicked 51 through 55 should be shown.
Your program should work for any number of students. There are 54 students in index.html, but you can test your code by adding the JavaScript file your write to the other lists of students we’ve provided in the student-list-examples folder.

# extra credit
Include a search component so that a user could search for a particular student or students. See the file example-exceeds.html and lines 16-19 for what the markup for the search component should look like.
When the "Search" button is clicked, the list of students is filtered to match the search. For example if the name Phillip is typed into the box list all students whose name or email includes Phillip.
If no matches are found by the search, include a message in the HTML to tell the user there are no matches.
